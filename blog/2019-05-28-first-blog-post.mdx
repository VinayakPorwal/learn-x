In just 6 to the point steps:

<!--truncate-->

## Step 1: Initialize Git

To initialize Git in your project folder, open your terminal and navigate to your project directory. Then, run the following command:

```js
git init
```

This will create a new Git repository in your project folder.

## Step 2: Add files to the repository

To add all the files in your project folder to the Git repository, run the following command:

```js
git add .
```

This will stage all the files in your project folder for commit.

## Step 3: Commit changes

To commit the changes in your Git repository, run the following command:

```js
git commit -m "First commit"
```

This will create a new commit with a message "First commit" in your Git repository.

## Step 4: Create a new repository on GitHub

To push your code to GitHub, you need to create a new repository on GitHub. To create a new repository, go to GitHub and click on the "New" button on the homepage. Then, enter a repository name, choose whether it should be public or private, and click on the "Create repository" button.

## Step 5: Add remote to your Git repository

To add the new repository on GitHub as a remote to your Git repository, run the following command:

```js
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourgithubname/yourgiithubrepo.git
```

Replace "yourgithubname" and "yourgiithubrepo" with your GitHub username and repository name, respectively.

## Step 6: Push changes to GitHub

To push the changes in your Git repository to the new repository on GitHub, run the following command:

```js
git push -u origin main
```

This will push your code to the new repository on GitHub and set the default branch to "main".

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You have now created your first Git repository and pushed your code to GitHub. ðŸŽ‰
